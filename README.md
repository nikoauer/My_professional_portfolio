# <Niko Auer Portfolio>

## Description

This is a portfolio page to showacase my html and css skills in showcasing my future applications. In building a portfolio front page it has allowed me to better exercise, understand and problem solve in both html and css while also presenting my work capabilities around these frameworks. Through the process of developing this portfolio I better learned the importance of:
- colour contrast
- font styling
- pseudo-elements and pseudo selectors
- wireframing a prototype structure
- Sourcing inspiration for designs
- better understanding the role of display in flex layouts
- the importance of positioning (relative/absolute)
- designing responsive layout for differing screen sizes
