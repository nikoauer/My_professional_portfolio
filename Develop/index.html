                <p>Hi, my name is Niko Auer an aspiring digital design and developer. I have worked in television broadcast and the photography industry for the last 9 years and have had the opportunity to work on a range of amazing projects. Ranging from enormous international events such as the 2023 Qatar FIFA World Cup, Australian Open, UCI Road World Championships, Gran Turismo World Series all the way to local TV shows and events such as Tropfest, Love Island, NRL, AFL, Netball and more. I believe my experience in working in a high pressure environment along with my experience of being part of the process of working in a team environment to produce world class productions would be invaluable in the world of web developmnent. The industry is always changing and evolving just like the coding industry and so I am a lifelong learner. If I am not working or studying, I spend most of my time rock climbing and training.</p>
